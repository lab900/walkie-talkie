"""Move each Whisper word's start onto the speech it names (2026-10-04).

Whisper's word timings (cross-attention DTW) make the words contiguous: the word
after a pause *starts in the pause*. Measured on 60 of Victor's dictations
(`evals/local-word-timing/`): after every pause of 0.25 s or more, the next
word's start sat a median **620 ms before the audio's own voice onset** (p10
1.7 s early), while parakeet-tdt's sat 60 ms before it. A screenshot taken in
that pause therefore landed one word late — in the pause only 24 % of the time.

The fix is the audio, not the model: 20 ms RMS frames, voiced = 12 dB over the
clip's 10th-percentile floor and over the relay meter's absolute floor (180 on
int16), two voiced frames in a row = an onset. A word whose start is silent is
moved to the first onset inside it, 40 ms early; a word with no onset inside it
is left alone. Pure numpy, ~1 ms for a minute of audio.
