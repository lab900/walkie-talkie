# **The lab: a macOS guest to run the live tests in, off Victor's screen** (2026-09-25).
#
# Victor: *"I would like to test the features such as binding to terminals, binding
# to visual code and IntelliJ, drag, cut, move, all the features, but that if you
# test live on my machine, you'll distract me. Is there any way I could install
# Mac OS on a VM on this machine?"*
#
# A Tart VM (Apple's Virtualization.framework) runs headless. Synthetic mouse and
# keyboard events posted inside it stay inside it: no 🔒 on his screen, no cursor
# taken. Look at it only when you want to, over Screen Sharing (`vm-lab.sh look`).
#
#   vm-lab.sh up              start `wt-lab` headless (created from `wt-base` if missing)
#   vm-lab.sh deploy [app]    copy the app (default: the installed build) in and launch it
#   vm-lab.sh api <path> [json]   GET, or POST the json, to the app's control port in the guest
#   vm-lab.sh sh <cmd…>       run a command in the guest, as `admin`, in its login session
#   vm-lab.sh shot [out.png]  the guest's screen, copied out
#   vm-lab.sh look            open Screen Sharing on the guest (admin / admin)
#   vm-lab.sh down            shut it down
#   vm-lab.sh reset           throw `wt-lab` away; the next `up` clones a clean one
#
# **Tart is pinned to 2.34.0** (installed from the GitHub release into /Applications/tart.app,
# linked as /opt/homebrew/bin/tart): 2.35+ need a newer Swift runtime than macOS 15 ships
# (`libswiftCompatibilitySpan.dylib` not found), and the brew tap's formula does not parse.
# **The guest can be no newer than the host**, hence Sequoia.
#
# The privacy grants (Accessibility, Screen Recording, microphone) are the guest's own,
# ticked once by hand over `look`, then kept in `wt-base` — `reset` does not lose them
# once they are there (see `bake`).

# **Everything Tart stores lives on the external disk "Vic"** (2026-09-26, Victor: *"e important să
# nu se stocheze pe discul meu mult … totul să fie cât de mult se poate pe acel hard extern"*): the
# internal disk had 88 GiB free against a 25 GB base image plus clones. `TART_HOME` is the one knob
# Tart offers (OCI cache, IPSW cache, VMs, tmp all live under it); the volume is APFS, which the
# sparse disk images need. Refuse to run without it rather than silently fill the internal disk.
#
# **`wt-lab` moved to the internal disk on 2026-09-29** (Victor, 28 Sep 22:30: *"move the VM back on
# my Mac disk to increase speed"*): the USB HDD made a boot take minutes and every guest build read
# through it. `~/tart` holds only `vms/wt-lab` (+ the night stamp); the base image and the OCI cache
# stay on Vic (`/Volumes/Vic/tart`) and are not needed to run the lab. `TART_HOME=/Volumes/Vic/tart`
# still points at the old copy, renamed `wt-lab.moved-2026-09-29`.
