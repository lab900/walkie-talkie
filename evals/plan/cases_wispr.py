"""**Wispr Flow as the engine** — TW1–TW21 (2026-09-28), the outline in
`evals/plan/wispr/D-state.md` §3, mapped to the findings of the four adversarial reviews
(`A-lifecycle.md` W-A*, `B-errors.md` W-B*, `C-firewall.md` W-C*, `D-state.md` W-D*).

Two kinds of case:

- **desk** — run on the host, Engine = Wispr, but Wispr's real process never hears a thing:
  the app reads a **fake `History`** (`fake_wispr_db.py`, switched in through a `WT_WISPR_DB=`
  line in `elevenlabs.env` between two `# fake-wispr:` marks, removed after every case) and
  **Wispr's chords are muted** (`POST /test/wispr-chord {"mute": true}` — only their stamped
  trailing `flagsChanged []` goes out). Rows are inserted and rewritten by the case the way Wispr
  writes them (B §1). The relay's own recorder is pointed at the Loopback (`/test/mic`) so no
  real microphone opens. Assertions read `GET /test/state` (`wisprLive`, `pasteboard`, the
  usual fields), the log and the witness tab — never a screenshot.
- **lab** (`lab_only=True`) — the real Wispr in the Tart guest, audio through BlackHole
  (`docs/vm-lab.md`, `docs/vm-wispr.md`); SKIP on the host.

Every case needs Wispr running (`needs_wispr`: a host without it SKIPs); a desk case also needs
an installed build with the hooks (`wisprLive` in `/test/state`). Verdicts: **BUG** = the
review's prediction confirmed (most of these are expected-fail today), **PASS** = the app does
what the review asks for, **FAIL** = neither."""
