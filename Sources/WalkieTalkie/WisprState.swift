/// **A measured state machine for Wispr Flow**, driven by three inputs that

///
/// ## Why a machine, and why now
///
/// Until today the relay's whole model of Wispr was one boolean read off
/// CoreAudio (`WisprWatch`) and one row read off SQLite (`WisprHistory`), and
/// nothing joined them. Both failures of 2026-09-13 are what that costs:
///
/// - `WisprWatch` is **0–6 s late and misses short dictations entirely**. It
///   publishes only when the value it re-reads *differs* from the last one, so a
///   sentence shorter than its own lag produces neither an opening nor a closing
///   edge. With Wispr's microphone pinned to the Loopback device `🎓 TO Wispr`
///   (whose physical source keeps the stream warm) it saw **no edge at all** in
///   five successful runs.
/// - Everything the wrap hangs off that closing edge — the swallow window, the
///   `History` poll, the settle — therefore never armed, and `speculativeGrace`
///   fired *Wispr ignored the chord* about a sentence that had already been
///   pasted into Word.
///
/// So the relay stops believing one signal and starts **joining three**, each
/// with its own latency, and says what it is joining:
///
/// | input | what it proves | measured latency |
/// |---|---|---|
/// | the chord this app posts | a dictation was *asked for* | 0 (it is the clock) |
/// | a 100 ms poll of `kAudioProcessPropertyIsRunningInput` | a microphone **is** open | the poll's own tick |
/// | `WisprWatch`'s CoreAudio notification | the same fact, pushed | 0–6 s, and sometimes never |
/// | the `History` row at 150 ms | Wispr **has the sentence** | row created at the gesture |
///
/// The poll and the notification are deliberately kept as two inputs rather than
/// collapsed into the faster one: the lag between them is a number the next
/// feature needs (Victor's replay buffer has to know when Wispr is *ready*), and
/// a number nobody measures is a number that drifts. `lags` is that measurement
/// and it is in `GET /test/state`.
///
/// ## It owns nothing
///
/// No timers, no CoreAudio, no SQLite, no AppKit. Inputs in, phase out, a
/// callback on every transition — which is what makes
/// `POST /test/wispr-state/simulate` able to run a scripted day through it in a
/// millisecond and assert on the transitions, with no microphone and no Wispr.

/// everything to main at the boundary, which is `DictationSource`'s rule), and
