"""**Is it safe to restart Walkie Talkie right now?** The gate `relay-restart.sh` waits on.

Victor, 2026-09-23: *"Whenever you restart it, make sure it's not currently
dictating or transcribing. Make sure it's idle before you restart the app …
After the clean insert of the text [and submit], only then restart. Maybe,
granted, even 10 more seconds in case I routed the prompt to the wrong place,
and then only then restart."*

Victor, 2026-09-28 18:39, after a restart landed while he was dictating:
*"someone just restarted the walkie while I was dictating. that should never
happen (while dictating or transcribing). restart is only possible after 5 secs
of inactivity after the last insert of text."*

Victor, 2026-09-28 21:20: *"there should only be 5 seconds since the last ended
dictation for the walkie deploy to be authorized to happen."* — so the wait on
his hands (5 s since his last key, click or scroll, added at 18:39) is gone
again: his typing is not a dictation.

So the gate opens only when both of these hold:

1. **Nothing is dictating or transcribing, on any engine** — `GET
   /test/state.busy` (the app's `restartBlockers`: every microphone of its own,
   the recogniser, the local fallback, the sentence queue, the live caption, the
   prompt on screen, a sentence held for a bind, the words being typed, audio
   staged for Recover — and since 2026-09-28 **Wispr Flow's own microphone and a
   History row it is still working on**), plus the same Wispr checks made here,
   from `wisprLive` and from Wispr's `flow.sqlite` read directly, so an app
   installed before that fix is gated too. An older build without `busy` is read
   from the flags it does have.
2. **`QUIET_AFTER_DELIVERY` (5 s) since the last ended dictation** — the last
   poll that saw it busy, `lastDelivery.at`, `lastInsertAt` (a clipboard write,
   Wispr's newest finished row), a dictation start or stop, the outbox's mtime.
   Anything new restarts the countdown.

**No escape for an app that does
not answer** (2026-09-28): a frozen relay is still not a reason to cut into a
dictation. The gate waits, and after `UNREACHABLE_REFUSE` seconds refuses (exit
4) with a note for the operator; `--force` goes past that one refusal only, only
for a human at a terminal (it asks to type `force`), and still waits for Wispr
and for his hands. One escape stays: a `dictating` flag with no microphone, no
recogniser and no Wispr sentence behind it for 30 s (the
`/test/dictation/start` stuck flag of 2026-09-14).

**A harness run holds it too** (2026-09-28 21:26: an install asked for by Victor
landed between two sentences of a desk run — the relay came back on the run's
engine, bound to its witness tab, and the run was spoilt). `~/.walkie-talkie/
wispr-loop.lock` (`pid started`, the one runner lock on this Mac) with a live pid
keeps the gate closed; a dead pid's lock is ignored.

`wait` polls every second (the cadence, not the gate) and exits 0 when open,
3 at `--max-wait`, 4 when it refuses. `once` prints one reading as JSON. The
logic is `Gate`, unit-tested by `evals/test_restart_gate.py` with a fake clock.
