"""**One engine for every way to dictate, checked against the source.**

Victor, 2026-10-06 (dictated):

    "There are four ways to dictate, right? Bound, at caret, in a new terminal
     or clean dictation. I just started a new prompt for a new terminal, and what
     was used was the local model. The model that is used for transcribing should
     be the same for all four, always. Make sure in the code that this never
     drifts again."

That sentence went local because Wispr Flow was still finishing the take the
relay had handed to this Mac six seconds before, and ignored the start chord —
not because the new-session gesture picked another engine. The guarantee is
structural, and this file pins it:

1. Every gesture opens the microphone through `AppDelegate.startDictation`, and
   that function is the only caller of `source.start()` — one variable, one call.
2. No source is ever started by name (`wisprSource.start()` …): that would be a
   gesture choosing its own engine.
3. The engine is only ever swapped for a sentence by `borrowEngine`, and only
   for the hard failures listed in `BORROWS` — each one inside the shared start
   path or the right ⌘⌥ hold's pre-step, never in a gesture's own branch. A new
   borrow has to be added here, with its reason, or this fails.

Run: `python3 evals/test_one_engine.py` (exit 1 on a drift).
