/// **How the bridge gets Wispr back to live after starting late** (2026-09-29).
///
/// Victor: *"the voice is captured the moment I start dictating and then is fed
/// with a bit of an offset … to Wispr Flow … We could also try a speed up of the
/// voice to 1.1x for a few seconds to recover … after a few seconds there should
/// be no lag between my voice and what Wispr hears."*
///
/// Wispr opens its input 0.3–0.7 s after the gesture when warm, 5–6 s cold
/// (`WisprState`'s witness table). The relay records from the gesture, so it
/// holds that head and hands it over the moment Wispr is listening — a lag, not
/// a loss. Three things take the lag back out, cheapest first:
///
/// 1. **The silence before his first word is cut at the hand-over**
///    (`trimStart`): the gap between the click and the first syllable is most
///    of a warm Wispr's lag, and it carries nothing. `leadPad` of it is kept so
///    the first consonant is not clipped.
/// 2. **While lagging, a pause is shortened to `keptGap`** (`admit`) — a
///    recogniser needs to hear a pause, not its length.
/// 3. **While lagging, the player runs faster** (`rate`) through a time-pitch
///    unit, so his voice is faster but not higher: `catchUpRate` (1.1×) near
///    live, rising with the lag to `maxRate` at `rampLag` behind.
///
/// **The ceiling is Wispr's, and past it he waits** (2026-09-30). Measured in
/// `evals/wispr-catchup/`: at a flat 1.1× a start 5 s late took a median 7.9 s
/// to reach live, so a short sentence was heard sped up from end to end — and a
/// stop one second after Wispr started listening leaves ~6 s of him queued.
/// Victor: *"accelerarea asta trebuie să aibă un anumit plafon, peste care
/// probabil Wispr să nu mai poată înțelege … îmi asum această procesare
/// întârziată"*. So the speed is capped at the fastest Wispr still transcribes
/// (`maxRate`, `WT_BRIDGE_MAX_RATE`), and whatever that cannot absorb is drained
/// after his stop, however long it takes (`WisprFlowSource.bridgeDrainSeconds`).
///
/// **"Live" is `synced` of queue, not zero** — the recorder hands over ~85 ms
/// buffers, so a queue running faster than it is filled starves between them,
/// and a starved player puts silence into the middle of a word. At `synced`
/// the rate is back to 1.0 and the queue refills to about one buffer.
///
/// Pure: no audio, no clock — `BridgePacerTests` drives it.
