"""Long-lived local transcriber for Walkie Talkie.

**It is a daemon and not a script because of one measurement**: importing
`mlx_whisper` costs 7.4s and the first transcription pays another 2.8s to load
the weights, while a second one takes 1.3s. Shelling out per dictation would put
ten seconds between Victor finishing a sentence and the agent seeing it — so the
process starts once, warms up once, and then answers in about a tenth of the
audio's length.

Protocol, one JSON object per line each way:

    →  {"wav": "/path/to/file.wav", "words": true}      (`words` optional)
    →  {"pcm": "/path/to/window.pcm", "segments": true}  (live captions, below)
    ←  {"ok": true, "text": "…", "language": "ro", "avg_logprob": -0.21,
        "compression_ratio": 1.4, "no_speech_prob": 0.0, "decode_s": 0.83,
        "words": [{"text": " există", "start": 1.54, "end": 2.56}, …],
        "memory": {"active_mb": 1543.3, "cache_mb": 512.2, "peak_mb": 2365.8,
                   "cache_limit_mb": 512}}
    ←  {"ok": false, "error": "…"}

and once, unprompted, at start-up:

    ←  {"ready": true, "model": "…", "memory": {…}}
       (or {"ready": false, "error": "…"})

`memory` is MLX's own accounting and is the only place that separates the
weights from the Metal buffer pool — see `memory_stats` and the cache-limit
note below it. Consumers may ignore it; nothing in the protocol depends on it.

stdout carries **only** protocol lines. mlx and huggingface both write progress
bars and warnings to stdout, so every model call is wrapped in a redirect —
without it the first tqdm bar corrupts the stream and the relay sees garbage.

Three decode settings here were measured rather than guessed — the language
pin, the vocabulary prompt and `condition_on_previous_text`. See
`evals/short-clip-lid.md` for the first two (803 of Victor's own clips, four
configs, 3212 decodes).

`condition_on_previous_text=False` is the oldest of them. Left at its default (True), 3 of 20
sample dictations fell into repetition loops — "nu știu, nu știu, nu știu…" for
forty words — and because every looped word is an insertion, those three alone
moved pooled WER from 37% to 50%. The flag is right *here* and would be wrong in
victor-macos-addons, which streams short chunks and genuinely needs the previous
one for continuity.

# Victor speaks these two and no others. Whisper picks a language off its 30s
# window *before* it decodes a word, and with three seconds of speech and
# twenty-seven of padding in that window the pick is a guess — a guess that does
# not produce a wrong word but a fluent sentence in a language nobody spoke.
# Measured over 803 clips: 50% of those under 2s, 28% at 2-3s and 19% at 3-4s
# came back in neither of these. Restricting the argmax to the two takes that to
# **0% in every bucket**, and it is free — `transcribe(language=None)` already
# runs this exact encoder pass internally, so pinning only relocates it (paired
# cost: -22ms).

# **The words he says that a general model has never heard him say.**
#
# Whisper's `initial_prompt` is decoder context, not a filter: it does not
# constrain the output, it makes these spellings cheap. Recall on these very
# terms over their 490 occurrences in the reference transcripts went 0.67 -> 0.88
# with it — `Claude` 0.33 -> 0.85 (without it the model writes `cloud`, `claw`,
# and turns `CLAUDE.md` into `CloudMD`), `frontend` 0.10 -> 0.70, `petclinic`
# 0.00 -> 0.60, `backend` 0.44 -> 0.92, `IntelliJ` 0.59 -> 0.88. Median WER under
# five seconds went 0.300 -> 0.222.
#
# **Every term is attested in his own transcripts and was most broken without
# this.** `Devoxx`, `repo` and `VS Code` were guessed at, checked against the
# corpus (0, 1 and 2 occurrences) and thrown out. A prompt is capped at 224
# tokens and attention weights its tail hardest, so it is a short list of things
# that actually go wrong — not a glossary.
#
# **It costs repetition loops**, which is why `compression_ratio` is now read on
# the Swift side: 7 more across 803 clips, all of them caught by that ratio and
# none of them by the `avg_logprob` floor, because a loop is *confidently*
# wrong.

# **The prompt is chosen by the language, because the two languages fail
# differently.** Mining the substitutions of 129 clips decoded with no prompt at
# all, the top English errors are the terms above (`claude` -> `cloud`, `md` ->
# `cloudmd`); the top *Romanian* errors are not vocabulary at all, they are
# **diacritics** — `să` -> `sa` (10), `în` -> `in` (6), `și` -> `si` (4),
# `compară` -> `compara` — the model writing Victor's language flat. A glossary
# of English product names buys nothing against that, and the measurement says
# so: on Romanian clips the list above moves WER 23.8% -> 24.1%, i.e. nowhere.
#
# What does move it is decoder context that is *itself* written in diacritics.
# Measured on 548 held-out clips (never searched on), routing Romanian to the
# list below and leaving English on the list above:
#
#     overall   15.9% -> 15.2%   (bootstrap 2000x: -0.69, 95% CI [-1.27, -0.19],
#                                 better in 100% of resamples)
#     Romanian  22.6% -> 21.2%
#     English    8.7% ->  8.7%   (unchanged by construction)
#     repetition loops  7 -> 5
#
# **Routing is what makes it safe.** The same Romanian prompt applied to *every*
# clip is a disaster — 18 loops in 129 against 2, because Romanian context over
# English audio decodes into Romanian-shaped noise and runs away (`Chau coă coă
# coă…`). Nearly all of those loops are on non-Romanian clips, which routing
# never shows it. The LID pass already knows the answer before decoding starts;
# this only stops throwing it away.
#
# **The gain is small and the dev set lied about it.** On the 129 clips the
# search ran over it read -1.9 points; on the two held-out sets, -2.7 and -0.5.
# The honest figure is the pooled -0.7. Kept because it is consistent in every
# split, never worse on English, and costs fewer loops, not more.
# **It carries the English terms too, and that is not redundancy.** The first
# version of this list was Romanian only, and WER liked it — but term recall
# caught what WER could not see: he speaks Romanian *with English terms in it*,
# and a Romanian-only prompt stops priming them. On the same held-out clips,
# `backend` fell 0.88 -> 0.50 and `claude` 0.88 -> 0.75 while the diacritics rose.
# Adding the technical terms back costs nothing (45 of the 224 tokens were used)
# and buys them back above where they started:
#
#     term        today   ro-only   this list
#     să           0.88     0.94      0.93

#     backend      0.88     0.50      1.00
#
# `commit` sits at 0.41 under every prompt tried — it is heard as `me`, and no
# amount of decoder context has moved it. Left documented rather than solved.
