/// **The relay carries his voice to Wispr, instead of standing beside it**
/// (2026-09-14).
///
/// Victor: *"intermediaza tu sunetul din microfonul fizic pana la wisprflow,
/// pentru a avea control complet pe insertii audio / start/ end"*.
///
/// ## Why it exists: mixing is not inserting
///
/// Until now a shot marker was **played into** the Loopback device Wispr
/// listens to, which sums it with his voice — and a recogniser handed two voices
/// at once transcribes the one that makes a sentence. Measured: a marker six
/// seconds into an unbroken twelve-second sentence left **no trace at all**,
/// although it is the louder of the two signals. There is no level that fixes
/// that; the only fix is to stop being a second voice.
///
/// So the relay takes the path:
///
/// ```
///   before   MacBook Pro Mic ──┐
///                              ├─→ 🎓 TO Wispr ──→ Wispr      (summed)
///            relay (a marker) ─┘
///
///   after    MacBook Pro Mic ──→ relay ──→ 🎓 TO Wispr ──→ Wispr
///                                 ▲
///                          markers spliced into the queue
/// ```
///
/// The player node's own queue **is** the delay line: `scheduleBuffer` plays what
/// it is given in the order it is given, so a marker handed to it between two of
/// his buffers is heard between them. Nothing is mixed and nothing is dropped —
/// his sentence simply arrives at Wispr the marker's length later.
///
/// ## The one-time change this needs, and why it is off until then
///
/// **The physical microphone has to stop being a direct source of
/// `🎓 TO Wispr`**, leaving Pass-Thru alone — otherwise his voice reaches Wispr
/// twice, once live and once through here a fraction of a second later, which is
/// worse than anything this fixes. That is a change in Loopback's own window and
/// **only Victor can make it**: Loopback ships no `.sdef` and no
/// `NSAppleScriptEnabled`, so nothing here can read or set it.
///
/// Hence `WT_BRIDGE=1` — until From Walkie, below.
///
/// ## What it costs, stated plainly
///
/// With the microphone removed as a direct source, **Wispr hears nothing while
/// the relay is not running.** It does not fall back: `rankedAudioDevices` (8
/// entries, `Built-in mic` at rank 1, `Auto-detect` at 2) is walked when a device
/// **disappears**, and a Loopback device whose feeder is dead is still present —
/// merely silent. What Wispr does then is raise `NoAudio`, which it has shown 62
/// times already, so the failure is visible rather than silent. The way back is
/// one click in Wispr's own microphone setting.
///
/// ## From Walkie: the bridge is the only way in (2026-09-29)
///
/// Victor: *"I need this so I have a single source to select the input
/// microphone … and not have Wispr Flow pick a different device than I picked in
/// walkie-talkie"*, and *"not miss the first half a second or a full second of
/// speech"*. The Loopback caveat above is gone with the Loopback device: **From
/// Walkie** (`FromWalkieDevice`, `../from-walkie`) carries only what is played
/// into it, exists only while the relay runs, and Wispr ranks it first. So the
/// bridge is **on by default** (`WT_BRIDGE=0` turns it off) and aimed there
/// (`WT_BRIDGE_DEVICE` overrides), and his microphone is whatever
/// `InputDevice.resolve()` says — the meter's device — for Wispr as well.
///
/// **Held until Wispr listens.** From Walkie is BlackHole underneath: what is
/// written before a reader opens is simply gone. So `start(holding: true)` keeps
/// every buffer from the gesture, and `release()` — called the moment Wispr's
/// input is running — hands them over, the silence ahead of his first word cut
/// and the rest paced back to live by `BridgePacer` (pauses shortened, 1.1×
/// through `AVAudioUnitTimePitch`). The stop chord still waits for the queue
/// (`queuedSeconds`), so Wispr ends a little after he did, never before.
