"""The sentence queue (Q12, fix batch 6, 2026-09-26): a sentence may start while the previous one is
still transcribing; at most 2 in flight; each keeps its own envelope; deliveries strictly in the order
spoken; with Autosend off the panels one at a time, in order; a third start refused with a flash;
🔼← cancels the recording sentence, or with none recording the most recent one in flight.

Real audio through our Loopback (like `cases_audio`), the witness tab bound, faults from
`POST /test/eleven` — `{"fail": "delay", "delayMs": n}` is the real call made n ms late (batch 6) —
and `POST /test/autosend {"on"}` (gap G6, batch 6, this run only). Every case SKIPs on a build without
`state.sentenceQueue` (installed before batch 6) or with the queue off (`WT_SENTENCE_QUEUE=0`).

Not run the night it was written (the teacher batch had the Mac): run after the morning install,
`HANDS_OFF=1 python3 evals/plan/harness.py --only 'Q[1-6]'` under the hands-off locks."""
