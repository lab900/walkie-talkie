/// **The live caption as a film subtitle across the top of the screen**
/// (2026-09-26). Victor: *"pui subtitrarea live pe o bandă de înălțime 80 px pe
/// partea de sus a ecranului ca o subtitrare. font alb cu bordură/shadow negru
/// … ideal textul să se miște uniform smooth de la dreapta spre stânga, în ciuda
/// cuvintelor din transcriere care se modifică live … ochiul să urmărească lin
/// textul. Îl scoți așadar din tooltip."*
///
/// One borderless, click-through panel, `bandHeight` tall, pinned to the top
/// of the Retina (since 2026-10-05; the pointer's screen before) — under the menu
/// bar, so neither covers the other. White text with a black outline and a
/// soft shadow, and since 2026-09-28 a backdrop (below).
///
/// **Two lines that roll up, not a line that scrolls left** (2026-09-28).
/// Victor: *"We need to work a bit on the subtitles. Not very happy with how
/// they look, scrolling text to the left. When new text is added onto the
/// right, that's okay. But then when a full line is filled up, a second line
/// should be written below the first one. The first one should stay at the
/// maximum of eighty percent of the screen width. And then when the second
/// line gets full as well, it pushes up the first line out of screen,
/// basically. And on silence, there is no fade coming from the left, but
/// instead, the whole line is pushed up after sufficient time to read it.
/// Also, in case there is a break in the speech that results in a new
/// sentence being started, I'd like to have that other sentence starting on
/// the second line, therefore initiating a new line, even if the first line
/// isn't entirely full. But then once it's on the second line, even if under
/// a correction the sentence is merged with the previous one, it still
/// remains on the second line. And corrections still are smooth. The font
/// should be also slightly less bold and twenty percent smaller."*
///
/// - **Two slots, a line ≤ `maxLineShare` (80 %) of the band's width.** Words
///   are appended on the right of the current line; a word that would take the
///   line past 80 % starts the next line. When a third line is needed the top
///   one glides up and out (`lineGlide`, the same exponential ease as the
///   reflow, fading as it crosses the band's top edge) and the second takes its
///   slot. Nothing scrolls sideways any more, and **the eraser is gone**.
///   **In that order** (Victor, same day: *"când ar trebui să apară rândul 3,
///   atunci rândul 1 iese în sus, și după ce rândul 2 devine 1, atunci începe
///   să apară și rândul '3' pe poziția 2"*): line 1 starts leaving the frame
///   the word that needs line 3 arrives; line 2 glides up; only once it has
///   landed does the new line's entry front start. Words that arrive during
///   the glide wait on the new line, unrevealed — none is dropped or shown
///   early. Generally: **a line's letters come in only while it, and every
///   line above it, stands still** (`landed`), so a silence roll-up holds a
///   word said mid-glide the same way (a word already half in finishes as
///   its line rides up). Line 1 never leaves while line 2 is still filling.
/// - **Each line is centred on the band** — an assumption, not his words: it
///   keeps his standing rule *"the visible text remains ~centered at all
///   times"* (2026-09-26 07:50) and is how film subtitles sit. So a line
///   still re-centres by half of each word's ink as it grows (the feed-forward
///   ease of batch 5, now per line); it never travels further than that.
/// - **Silence lifts a line after a read time**: `readTime = max(readMin 3 s,
///   readPerWord 0.3 s × words on the line)` — an assumption (he said *"after
///   sufficient time to read it"*). The clock is silence: it starts at the last
///   new word (a gentle batch correction does not restart it, as it did not
///   wake the eraser), and after a line has left it restarts for the next one,
///   so the line that just moved up is given its own read time in its new
///   place. When both are gone the band stays up, empty, as it did after a
///   full wipe, and closes with the sentence.
/// - **A new sentence starts a new line.** The live engine commits a segment
///   at a VAD pause (1.5 s); a commit whose last word ends a sentence (`.`,
///   `?`, `!`, `…`) marks the next word to start a new line even if the current
///   one is short (`breakBefore`). A commit with no terminal punctuation is a
///   pause inside the sentence and changes nothing.
/// - **Lines are sticky per word.** Each word carries the line it was placed
///   on through every revision (the LCS alignment carries it, as it carries
///   the x); a correction's new words take the line of the words they replace,
///   so a batch correction that merges two sentences leaves the second one
///   where it is. A correction re-flows only inside its own line (and may make
///   that line wider than 80 % — it is never re-wrapped).
/// - **Font: 30.4 pt semibold** (38 bold before: 20 % smaller, one weight
///   lighter; medium was too thin under the 9 % black outline on video),
///   outline and shadow kept.
///
/// **A grey backdrop, and the band dodges the pointer** (2026-09-28). Victor:
/// *"pune o margine de 10x pe toate direcțiile de fundal gri semitransparent în
/// jurul textului subtitrării. În plus, câtă vreme mouse-ul este peste
/// subtitrarea de sus, ea să fugă jos (revine sus când mouse-ul iese din zona
/// subtitrării)"*.
/// - **Backdrop**: a rounded rect (radius `backdropRadius` 8), grey at 45 %,
///   `backdropPad` 10 pt around the union of the lines' text boxes on all four
///   sides — *"10x"* read as 10 pt (an assumption). It follows the text as the
///   eye sees it: widening with the ink, growing a line down when line 2
///   begins, shrinking when a line leaves — continuous motion followed frame
///   by frame, jumps eased (τ `lineGlide`); it fades out when the band empties.
/// - **Dodge**: while the pointer is inside the backdrop at the top, the band
///   **jumps** to the bottom of the same screen — in one frame, no pan, no fade
///   (Victor, same day: *"flip top/bottom should be without pan, sudden. no
///   animation"*) — the backdrop the same `edgeGap`
///   from the bottom edge as it was from the top (the block then grows upward).
///   It jumps back up once the pointer has been out of the top backdrop
///   (grown by `dodgeSlack` 12 pt) for `dodgeDebounce` 0.25 s — enter at once,
///   leave with hysteresis, so it cannot flap. The pointer is read every frame
///   (`NSEvent.mouseLocation`, what the chip rides on); `POST /test/live-caption
///   {"pointer": {"x", "y"}}` stands in for it at a desk (`null` gives it back).
///
/// **Corrections are a swap** (2026-09-26, unchanged): the replaced words fade
/// out where they stood (ghosts), the rest of their line glides to its new
/// layout, the new words fade in in a faded yellow that returns to white.
///
/// **Words enter letter by letter** (2026-09-27, unchanged). Victor: *"the
/// entering text at right should fade in character by character (the same way
/// it fades out at the left) ⇒ with less 'shocks' to the move."* An appended
/// word is swept by a front with a soft edge (`softEdge`) from its first letter
/// to its last at `revealSpeed`, one opacity per glyph (a `destinationIn`
/// mask). Its line makes room for it only as far as its ink has come in
/// (`appear`), so the re-centring moves with the letters.
